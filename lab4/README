To test, run:

python locu_predict.py models/matcher.pkl locu_file foursquare_file match_output

The following explains how we generate the model file. With steps to 
replicate that.  However, you could just use the provided trained model.

Assumes we have the following data files:

foursquare_test_hard.json   foursquare_train.json  locu_train_hard.json
foursquare_test.json        locu_test_hard.json    locu_train.json
foursquare_train_hard.json  locu_test.json

and matching files

matches_test_hard.csv  matches_train_hard.csv
matches_test.csv          matches_train.csv

which are provided.

Runnable python is in the following files:

locu_classifier.py
locu_matching.py
locu_predict.py

Here's an example:

python locu_classifier.py models/classifier.pkl
python locu_matching.py models/classifier.pkl models/matcher.pkl
python locu_predict.py models/matcher.pkl locu_test_hard.json foursquare_test_hard.json leaderboard_matching.csv
